## QML Challenge Leaderboard

Sharpen your QML skills and compete against other teams for top spot! 

The QML Challenge contains 12 individual problems, ranging in difficulty from building basic 
quantum circuits to implementing QML workflows. The problems can be tackled in any order, 
and harder questions are worth more points. The problems can be tackled individually or 
as part of a team (limit of one account per team).

### Power Ups

You can tackle the QML Challenges at any time during QHack, but there are some *Power Ups* that are available
to be won for those who start early. 

The top 80 teams on the Leaderboard at 6PM EST on Friday Feb 19 will receive $250 in credits. These credits can 
be used to build your QHack [Open Hackathon](Open_Hackathon.md) project. Teams can apply credits to any AWS service, including [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/), where they can showcase their ideas on Rigetti, IonQ, and D-Wave hardware or with high-performance simulators in the cloud
